# BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence

Correctly assigning bugs to the right developer or team, i.e., bug triaging, is a costly activity. A
concerted effort at Ericsson has been done to adopt automated bug triaging to reduce development
costs. We also perform a case study on Eclipse bug reports. In this work, we replicate the research
approaches that have been widely used in the literature including FixerCache. We apply them on
over 10k bug reports for 9 large products at Ericsson and 2 large Eclipse products containing 21
components. We find that a logistic regression classifier including simple textual and categorical
attributes of the bug reports has the highest accuracy of 79.00% and 46% on Ericsson and Eclipse
bug reports respectively.
Ericsson’s bug reports often contain logs that have crash dumps and alarms. We add this information
to the bug triage models. We find that this information does not improve the accuracy of bug
triaging in Ericsson’s context. Eclipse bug reports contain the stack traces that we add to the bug
triaging model. Stack traces are only present in 8% of bug reports and do not improve the triage
accuracy.
Although our models perform as well as the best ones reported in the literature, a criticism of bug
triaging at Ericsson is that accuracy is not sufficient for regular use. We develop a novel approach
that only triages bugs when the model has high confidence in the triage prediction. We find that we
improve the accuracy to 90% at Ericsson and 70% at Eclipse, but we can make predictions for 62%
and 25% of the total Ericsson and Eclipse bug reports,respectively.

## Install and Dependencies 

To setup python and install the libraries and prepare the dataset, please refer to [install](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/install.md)

## Generating the Results

To run the models and get the results, please refer to [run models](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/run_models.md)

### RQ1a. Textual & Categorical

How accurately do models containing textual and categorical features triage bugs?

1. Model M1: Logistic RegressionWith Textual Features - To get the results of Model M1, run [classification_text](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/ML_Text_Categorical/classification_text.py)

2. Model M3: Textual and Component - To get the results of Model M3, run [classification_text_component](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/ML_Text_Categorical/classification_text_component.py)

3. Model M4: Textual and Component (All developers)- To get the results of Model M3, run [classification_text_component_all_devs](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/ML_Text_Categorical/classification_text_component_all_devs.py)

### RQ1b. FixerCache

Does a developer’s affinity to working on specific components improve the accuracy of bug triaging?

1. Refer to the paper of Wang et al. [Fixer Cache](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2652536)

2. Run [prediction_fixer_cache](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/FixerCache/prediction_fixer_cache.py) to get the results of FixerCache Model

### RQ2. Crash traces
Does the information contained in alarm logs, crash dumps, and stack traces help in bug triaging?

1. Run the [prediction_by_msr](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/stacktrace_processing/prediction_by_msr.py) on existing data to get the results of the stack trace & commit score based model.

2. To Run the model on new data set, please follow the steps mentioned below.

    1. For setup of infozilla tool, please follow the steps from [infozilla](https://github.com/kuyio/infozilla)
    
    2. Download the comments of the bug reports. The structure of the location where the text file of comments should be kept is - path/bug_id/bug_id_comments.txt
    
    3. Run the [infozilla](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/stacktrace_processing/infozilla.py) after replacing the original path of the resources
    
    4. Run the [xml_parser](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/stacktrace_processing/xml_parser.py). This script runs with the xml output generated by infozilla creates a json where call depth is the key and the corresponding value is the source code file name
    
    5. Clone the eclipse code repositories locally and put their location in jdt_dict.json and platform_dict.json.
    
    6. Run the [source_code_path_in_repo_collector](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/stacktrace_processing/source_code_path_in_repo_collector.py) to extract the path of the source code file from the cloned Eclipse repository.
    
    7. Run the [prediction_by_msr](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/stacktrace_processing/prediction_by_msr.py) to get the final results.

### RQ3. Combined Model
Does the model trained with text, categorical and log features improve accuracy of bug triaging?

1. Run [classification_ensemble](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/ensemble/classification_ensemble.py) to get the result of Ensemble Model M6

### RQ4. High Confidence Predictions
What is the impact of high confidence prediction on the accuracy of triaging?

1. Run [classification_text_component_high_confidence](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/high_confidence_prediction/classification_text_component_high_confidence.py) by setting appropraite cut_off confidence in [config.json](https://github.com/CESEL/BugTriageEclipseHighConfidence/blob/master/resources/config.json)
